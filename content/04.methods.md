## Methods

- Data 
#### COCI
We used the March 2022 version of the COCI citation index [@doi:10.1007/s11192-019-03217-6] as the source of our citation data.
This dataset contains around 1.3 billion citations from ~73 million bibliographic resources.

#### Selecting fields
To differentiate between scientific fields, we needed a way to map papers to fields.
Fortunately, all the papers in Pubmed Central [CITE] have corresponding Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms.
While MeSH terms are varied and numerous, the subheadings of the Natural Science Disciplines (H01) category fit our needs.
However, MeSH terms are hierarchical, and vary greatly in their size and specificity.
To extract a balanced set of terms we recursively traversed the tree and selected headings with at least 10000 dois, that don't have multiple children that also meet the cutoff.


#### Building citation networks
The COCI dataset consists of pairs of DOI identifiers.
To convert these pairs into meaningful networks, we had to choose which papers constituted a network.

To make our networks correspond to fields of biological study, we assigned papers into groups using their 
That is to say that for each term in the Natural Science Di
