### The same paper will have different pageranks in different fields

To demonstrate different patterns present in the data, we visualized networks from three different field pairs.
The first, nanotechnology/microscopy is a fairly average network in terms of inter-field pagerank correlation [Fig. TODO A].
The second, immunochemistry/anatomy has a high correlation but still has outlier points [Fig. TODO B].
The third, proteomics/metabolomics shows two fields with a larger degree of difference between pageranks in each field [Fig. TODO C].

### This variance is not entirely field independent
It's hard to say that a paper with a large difference between field-specific pageranks is more important in one field than the other.
It's possible that the scores are skewed by different field sizes, or caused by randomness in MeSH tagging.

To disentangle the random chance from the actual differences in network structure, we needed something to compare against.
We settled on shuffilng citation networks in a way that preserved their citation counts while randomizing which papers they cite.
By doing so, we created 100 shuffled for each pair of fields where the degree distribution of the network is maintained but the global structure is removed from the networks.

TODO talk about percentile scores


Nanotech vs microscopy
The nanotechnology/microscopy plot has a normal number of variance, and clearly demonstrates the differences between fields.
In the center of the plot are papers that have similar percentile scores in both fields.
Towards the right side most (but not all!) papers have a high nanotech-microscopy score, indicating that they are more highly valued in the field of nanotechnology thant in microscopy.
Such papers include "A robust DNA mechanical device controlled by hybridization topology" and "Bioadhesive poly(methyl methacrylate) microdevices for controlled drug delivery", while other papers such as "Turning the spotlight on cellular imaging" appropriately have a lower nanotechnology-microscopy score despite falling far to the nanotech side of the distribution [CITE, CITE, CITE].
Meanwhile, the left side holds papers with strong negative scores, indicating the field of microscopy values the papers more.
The left side has papers like "Photostable luminescent nanoparticles as biological label for cell recognition of system lupus erythematosus patients" and "WSXM: a software for scanning probe microscopy and a tool for nanotechnology" [CITE, CITE].
The papers with a high pagerank and similar percentile scores between fields are likely to be influential in both fields. 
In nanotechnology/microscopy these papers are frequently nanocopic imaging papers like "IMaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution", "In vivo imaging of quantum dots encapsulated in phospholipid micelles", and  "Imagine intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution" [CITE, CITE, CITE].

immunochemistry vs anatomy
- High correlation, but still has outliers 

proteomics vs metabolomics
- Dispersion shows importance of difference score

### Here's a webapp 

To demonstrate our findings, we have also set up a webserver with all pairs of networks instead of solely the ones shown in this paper.
