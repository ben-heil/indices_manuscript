### The same paper will have different pageranks in different fields

To demonstrate different patterns present in the data, we visualized networks from three different field pairs.
The first, nanotechnology/microscopy is a fairly average network in terms of inter-field pagerank correlation [Fig. TODO A].
The second, immunochemistry/anatomy has a high correlation but still has outlier points [Fig. TODO B].
The third, proteomics/metabolomics shows two fields with a larger degree of difference between pageranks in each field [Fig. TODO C].

### This variance is not entirely field independent
It's hard to say that a paper with a large difference between field-specific pageranks is more important in one field than the other.
It's possible that the scores are skewed by different field sizes, or caused by randomness in MeSH tagging.

To disentangle the random chance from the actual differences in network structure, we needed something to compare against.
We settled on shuffilng citation networks in a way that preserved their citation counts while randomizing which papers they cite.
By doing so, we created 100 shuffled for each pair of fields where the degree distribution of the network is maintained but the global structure is removed from the networks.

TODO talk about percentile scores

### Here's a webapp 

To demonstrate our findings, we have also set up a webserver with all pairs of networks instead of solely the ones shown in this paper.
