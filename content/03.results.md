### The same paper will have different pageranks in different fields

To demonstrate different patterns present in the data, we visualized networks from three different field pairs.
The first, nanotechnology/microscopy is a fairly average network in terms of inter-field pagerank correlation [Fig. TODO A].
The second, immunochemistry/anatomy has a high correlation but still has outlier points [Fig. TODO B].
The third, proteomics/metabolomics shows two fields with a larger degree of difference between pageranks in each field [Fig. TODO C].

### This variance is not entirely field independent
It's hard to say that a paper with a large difference between field-specific pageranks is more important in one field than the other.
It's possible that the scores are skewed by different field sizes, or caused by randomness in MeSH tagging.

To disentangle the random chance from the actual differences in network structure, we needed something to compare against.
We settled on shuffilng citation networks in a way that preserved their citation counts while randomizing which papers they cite.
By doing so, we created 100 shuffled for each pair of fields where the degree distribution of the network is maintained but the global structure is removed from the networks.

TODO talk about percentile scores

The nanotechnology/microscopy plot has a normal amount of variance, and clearly demonstrates the differences between fields.
In the center of the plot are papers that have similar percentile scores in both fields.
Towards the right side most (but not all!) papers have a high nanotech-microscopy score, indicating that they are more highly valued in the field of nanotechnology thant in microscopy.
Such papers include "A robust DNA mechanical device controlled by hybridization topology" and "Bioadhesive poly(methyl methacrylate) microdevices for controlled drug delivery", while other papers such as "Turning the spotlight on cellular imaging" appropriately have a lower nanotechnology-microscopy score despite falling far to the nanotech side of the distribution [CITE, CITE, CITE].
Meanwhile, the left side holds papers with strong negative scores, indicating the field of microscopy values the papers more.
The left side has papers like "Photostable luminescent nanoparticles as biological label for cell recognition of system lupus erythematosus patients" and "WSXM: a software for scanning probe microscopy and a tool for nanotechnology" [CITE, CITE].
The papers with a high pagerank and similar percentile scores between fields are likely to be influential in both fields. 
In nanotechnology/microscopy these papers are frequently nanoscopic imaging papers like "Imaging intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution", "In vivo imaging of quantum dots encapsulated in phospholipid micelles", and  "Imagine intracellular fluorescent proteins at nanometer resolution" [CITE, CITE, CITE].

The immunochemistry/anatomy fields have much higher correlation in their shared papers, but still have some outliers.
Examples of papers preferred in the immunochemistry field are "Immunoelectron microscopic exploration of the Golgi complex", "Immunocytochemical and electrophoretic analyses of changes in myosin gene expression in cat posterior temporalis muscle during postnatal development", and "Electron microscopic demonstration of calcitonin in human medullary carcinoma of thyroid by the immuno gold staining method" [@doi:10.1177/31.8.6863900; @doi:10.1007/bf01682147; @doi:10.1007/bf00514331].
Papers preferred in anatomy include "Grafting genetically modified cells into the rat brain: characteristics of E. coli β-galactosidase as a reporter gene", "Vitamin-D-dependent calcium-binding-protein and parvalbumin occur in bones and teeth", and "Mapping of brain areas containing RNA homologous to cDNAs encoding the alpha and beta subunits of the rat GABAA gamma-aminobutyrate receptor" [@doi:10/dptnbm; @doi:10.1007/bf02405306; @doi:10.1073/pnas.85.20.7815]
Papers with high pagerank in both domains and a similar importance are "Studies of the HER-2/neu Proto-Oncogene in Human Breast and Ovarian Cancer", "Expression of c-fos Protein in Brain: Metabolic Mapping at the Cellular Level", and "Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunolocalization in paraffin sections: An index of cell proliferation with evidence of deregulated expression in some, neoplasms" [@doi:10.1126/science.2470152; @doi:10.1126/science.3131879; @doi:10.1002/path.1711620403].

Where immunochemistry/anatomy served as an example of a highly correlated pair of fields, papers in proteomics/metabolomics have very different pageranks between fields.
These fields illustrate one of the reasons why the difference in percentile scores is a useful metric: there is so much dispersion that it's hard to tell where a trend line should be.
When coloring by the difference in scores, however, it is easy to see which papers are valued more in each field.
The proteomics-heavy papers include "Proteomics Standards Initiative: Fifteen Years of Progress and Future Work", "Limited Environmental Serine and Glycine Confer Brain Metastasis Sensitivity to PHGDH Inhibition", and "A high-throughput processing service for retention time alignment of complex proteomics and metabolomics LC-MS data", [@doi:10.1021/acs.jproteome.7b00370;@doi:10/ghf85j;@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr094] while the metabolomics papers are "MeltDB: a software platform for the analysis and integration of metabolomics experiment data", "In silico fragmentation for computer assisted identification of metabolite mass spectra", and "The Metabonomic Signature of Celiac Disease" [@doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btn452;@doi:10/d7gpf5;@doi:10.1021/pr800548z].
The articles with high pagerank and importance in both fields include "Visualization of omics data for systems biology", "FunRich: An open access standalone functional enrichment and interaction network analysis tool", and "Proteomic and Metabolomic Characterization of COVID-19 Patient Sera" [@doi:10.1038/nmeth.1436;@doi:10.1002/pmic.201400515;@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.05.032].

TODO Journal plots

### Journals aren't a great proxy for field, as they often have papers present from multiple fields.
In addition to article metrics, papers are often prioritized by selecting prestigious journals.
In an attempt to quantify the relative importance of journals, scientists have created rankings using metrics like eigenfactor [CITE]. 
While such metrics return intuitively reasonable results, we discovered that the inherent aggregation that they apply masks differences between fields.

For example, when considering the fields nanotechnology or microscopy, the journal *Science* [CITE] is far and away the most influential journal based on median pagerank [CITE Fig].
*Science*'s dominance isn't universal though — it ranks fifth behind journals like *Nature* and *Cell* [CITE] when looking at immunochemistry and anatomy [CITE fig].

Further, while journals are sometimes used as a proxy measure for field [CITE Disruptive Papers published in Scientometrics], they often play host to interdisciplinary papers that may be more accurately assigned to a different field.
"The metabonomic signature of celiac disease" is a paper with an extremely high pagerank in the field of metabolomics, but it was actually published in the Journal of Proteome Research [CITE, CITE]!
