## Conclusion

Limitations:
- Different number of papers between fields can lead to imbalanced medians which can skew our journal plots
- Percentile score is only an ad-hoc measure, it removes all variation in a network 
- Binary comparisons, where often papers may fall into a number of relevant fields
